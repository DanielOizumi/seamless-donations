            <h3>Improve Outgoing Email Reliability</h3>
            Because every WordPress hosting environment is different, the built-in WordPress email capability often is
            somewhat unreliable. The following plugins use external mailing engines and substantially improve mailing
            reliability. Here’s <A
                href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-fix-wordpress-not-sending-email-issue/">a good
            explainer article from WPBeginner</A>.
            <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sendwp/">SendWP</a></h3>
            Hosted mail delivery service. Not free, but they do a lot of the work to ensure delivery.
             <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified/">SendGrid</a></h3>
            Send emails through SendGrid from your WordPress installation using SMTP or API integration. The SendGrid
            plugin is used for email delivery on this site.
            <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpmandrill/">wpMandrill by the MailChimp folks</a></h3>
            The wpMandrill plugin sends emails that are generated by WordPress through Mandrill, a transactional email
            service powered by MailChimp.
            <h3><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/">WP Mail SMTP</a></h3>
            Reconfigures the wp_mail() function to use SMTP instead of mail() and creates an options page to manage the
            settings. 400,00 downloads and 4.7 stars, so it’s definitely a relied-upon solution.
